## Group 3  
Name: Ting-Chih Chen and Xiao Guo  

## Dataset  
```bash
├── Dataset
│   ├── CelebA-100.zip
│   └── target_images.zip
```
CelebA-100.zip includes about 100 source images from CelebA and 100 perturbation images made from starGAN with imperceptible perturbations.  
target_images.zip includes three target images(Kobe, Obama, and Ariana). We use these target images to do deepfake.  

## Task-1 Break down the defender  
Method-1: fewshot-face-translation-GAN  
Method-2:   

## Task-2 Reverse the perturbation images to source images
