## Group 3  
Name: Ting-Chih Chen and Xiao Guo  

## Dataset  
Our Dataset is CelebA-100.zip.  
It includes 100 source images and 100 perturbation images(from starGAN).  
Then, we have three target images(Kobe, Obama, and Ariana) in target_images.zip.  
Before you run the codes, you should unzip it and make sure the root.  

## Task-1 Break down the defender  

## Task-2 Reverse the perturbation images to source images
