## Group 3  
Name: Ting-Chih Chen and Xiao Guo  

## Dataset  
-- CelebA-100.zip:  
This file includes about 100 source images from CelebA and 100 perturbation images made from starGAN with imperceptible perturbations.  

-- target_images.zip  
This file has three target images(Kobe, Obama, and Ariana). We use these target images to do deepfake.  

## Task-1 Break down the defender  

## Task-2 Reverse the perturbation images to source images
